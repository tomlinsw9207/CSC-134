"high level" and "low level"
"hard coding" vs "user input"

if it is at least trying to be english it's probably a high level language
low level is basically just the machine language
compilers translate between the two language to make my life much much much easier

TODO 
maybe do the bonus if me thinks me feels like doing such a thing mayhaps perchance
